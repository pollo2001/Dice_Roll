# **Dice Roll Simulator - ARM Assembly üé≤**

This project simulates **100 random dice rolls**, detects **runs** of consecutive identical values, and counts the total number of runs. Written in **ARM assembly**, it includes functions for **random dice roll generation** and **run detection**.

---

## **Included Files üìÅ**

- **`main.s`**: Generates dice rolls, stores them, and calls `count_run`.
- **`count_run.s`**: Detects runs of consecutive identical dice rolls and prints their lengths and total occurrences.
- **`roll_dice.s`**: Generates random dice rolls and stores them in an array.
- **`mod.s`**: Calculates the **modulo** to constrain rolls between 1 and 6.
- **`play_dice.s`**: Main function, initializes memory, seeds random number generator, and calls `roll_dice` and `count_run`.
- **`Makefile`**: Compiles and links the assembly files into an executable.

## **How It Works üöÄ**

1. **Random Dice Rolls**: The `roll_dice` function generates random dice rolls (1-6) and stores them.
2. **Run Detection**: The `count_run` function detects consecutive identical dice rolls and counts the total number of runs.
3. **Output**: Prints each run's length and the total number of runs.

## **Example üìã**

To compile and run:

```bash
make            # Compile and link all assembly files
./play_dice     # Run the program
```

-**Example output**:
```bash
Index 1: 3
Index 2: 3
Run 1: 3
Total runs: 1
```
